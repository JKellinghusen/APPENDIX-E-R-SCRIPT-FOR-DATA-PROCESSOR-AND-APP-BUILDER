	<span style="font-weight:bold; ">Provide more autonomy over how work is done </span>
</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt">
	<b>Why it matters</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Workplace autonomy refers to employees’ ability to control how, when, and where they complete their work. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0899764016634890" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">In humanitarian and development organizations</span></u></a>, this can take many forms, such as allowing field staff’s schedule to follow the local calendar, decentralized decision-making for local teams, or allowing office staff to work from home when if they prefer. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	In some situations, worker autonomy is a requirement, not a benefit. Aid workers operating in crisis zones need autonomy to adjust their response strategies in real time, while development professionals may require flexibility in managing stakeholder relationships and project timelines without constant approval from HQ.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Providing autonomy in how employees prioritize and execute tasks can enhance efficiency, <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/autonomous-teamwork-and-psychological-well-being" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">reduce stress</span></u></a>, and build trust between leadership and staff. Organizations that trust their employees to control their work will reap the rewards of <a href="https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4675&amp;context=lkcsb_research" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">higher productivity, lower turnover, and increased staff wellbeing</span></u></a>.
</p>

	<b>Recommendations</b>
</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Balance autonomy with structure</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-01021-004" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">While autonomy benefits employees</span></u></a>, an organization requires structure and consistency. Consider what aspects of the work are non-negotiable and ask your employees to meet those requirements while giving them the freedom to structure the rest of their work. Encourage managers to utilize a “macro-management” approach: providing high-level goals, deliverables and guidance, but allowing teams to determine the best approach to complete the project. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Keep in mind that even highly independent employees need organizational support and connection. When an employee’s trust in management is low, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0899764016634890" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">high levels of autonomy lead to lower work-life satisfaction</span></u></a>.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Some employees, especially younger ones, may struggle with autonomous work. Provide them with resources, training, and mentorship to help them thrive in self-directed tasks.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Be generous with autonomy</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Consider whether organizational structures actually benefit the organization. If not, get rid of the requirements. For example, if your employees are able to complete their tasks successfully while working from home, don’t make them come to the office every day. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	While some managers are concerned about employees not completing their work when they are remote, such disengagement is usually the result of poor management, rather than the work environment. Instead of forcing employees to commute to the office, dedicate more resources to engaging, challenging, and supporting them.&#xa0;
