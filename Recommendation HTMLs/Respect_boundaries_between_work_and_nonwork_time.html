	<span style="font-weight:bold; ">Respect boundaries between work and non-work time </span>
</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt">
	<b>Why it matters</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Blurred boundaries between work and personal time – feeling pressured to be available outside of working hours – contribute to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1542316620982971" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">psychological distress, burnout, and decreased overall well-being</span></u></a>. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0899764016634890" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">For humanitarian and development workers</span></u></a>, the challenge of separating work from personal time is even greater. Many employees work in crisis settings, across multiple time zones, or in roles where urgent needs arise unpredictably. While some level of flexibility is necessary, constant availability can lead to burnout and hinder long-term retention. Organizations that proactively set clear boundaries between work and personal time can improve workforce sustainability, reduce stress, and increase overall effectiveness.

	<b>Recommendations</b>

<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Establish clear digital boundaries</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	One of the most significant contributors to boundary violations is <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/building-work-life-boundaries-in-the-wfh-era" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">digital communication</span></u></a>, particularly emails, messaging apps, and work calls outside of office hours. Establish clear policies on after-hours communication, such as limiting work-related messages to business hours and ensuring that employees do not feel pressured to respond outside of their designated time. Pair employees who are “on call” outside of working hours with least one counterpart to divide on call duties.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Encourage leadership to model healthy boundaries</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Workplace culture is heavily influenced by leadership behavior. When managers and senior staff respect their own personal time and avoid engaging in non-essential work communication outside of office hours, employees feel empowered to do the same.<a href="https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/centers/cwf/rt/members/pdf/Kossek%20inpress10%20%20Managing%20Work-Life%20Boundaries%20in%20the%20Digital%20Age.pdf" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">&#xa0;</span></u><u><span style="color:#467886">Leaders can help create a healthier work environment</span></u></a> by setting expectations that protect work-life balance. 
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Support flexible scheduling without overextending workers</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/04/a-guide-to-setting-better-boundaries" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">Providing flexibility in work hours</span></u></a> can benefit employees managing personal responsibilities, but it must be implemented thoughtfully. Give employees the ability to adjust their schedules to accommodate their needs while ensuring that flexibility does not translate into an "always-on" culture. Structured flexibility – such as core work hours with optional start and end times – helps employees maintain a better work-life balance.
