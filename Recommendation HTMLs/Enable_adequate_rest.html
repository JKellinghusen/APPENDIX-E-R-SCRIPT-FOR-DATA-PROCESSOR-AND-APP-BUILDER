	<span style="font-weight:bold; ">Enable adequate rest </span>
</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt">
	<b>Why it matters</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Ensuring employees have adequate rest is crucial for both their physical and mental well-being. Insufficient rest has been found to lead to worse health, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355885053_Recovery_from_Work_Advancing_the_Field_Toward_the_Future" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">decreased performance</span></u></a>, <a href="https://oce-ovid-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/article/00060745-202210000-00002/HTML" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">higher likelihood of absenteeism</span></u></a>, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4610176/" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">higher healthcare costs</span></u></a>. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	During the workday, rest usually takes the form of dedicated breaks, including lunch breaks or other short periods of rest. Outside of work, rest includes leisure time, weekends, vacations, and, of course, nightly sleep. Aid organizations working in challenging environments have to be creative to ensure their employees have the opportunity to recover from the demands of work. This includes combating the “martyr” culture that drives many aid workers to overexert themselves for the sake of the mission. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Lack of adequate rest – especially sleep – has far-reaching negative implications ranging from <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2149325" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">lost productivity to work-family conflict</span></u></a> and even <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539298/" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">fatal accidents</span></u></a>.

	<b>Recommendations</b>
</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Incorporate dedicated periods of rest into organizational policies</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	While many governments mandate minimum rest periods, they are not designed for the unique work context of aid work. Tailor your policies to the specific conditions in which your employees work.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Managers must be advocates for rest</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Not only should they encourage employees to take necessary breaks, they must lead by example and normalize the practice of stepping away from work for some time each day. Practices like “working through lunch” must be the exception, not the norm.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Incentivize proper rest</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Provide opportunities for non-work activities during rest periods. These may be structured, such as daily friendly competitions between coworkers, or informal, such as managers inviting employees to a cup of tea.&#xa0; 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Provide alternatives to “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215302703" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">smartphone breaks</span></u></a>” which are less effective at recovering energy and, depending on the type of content consumed, may contribute to emotional exhaustion. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	While employees working from home have more autonomy about how they spend their time, managers should share best practices for rest, such as trading TV breaks for <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10239033/" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">outdoor walks</span></u></a>.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Set aside physical spaces for breaks</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	In an office setting, this might be a dedicated break room or lounge. Following findings that <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/19/10212" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">early afternoon naps improve cognitive performance</span></u></a>, employers have started allocating spaces for employees to close their eyes for some time. 
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Promote healthy post-work recovery and sleeping habits</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Discourage a culture of overwork by setting clear expectations for after-hours communication and work boundaries. Encourage employees <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036904" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">spend time after work on low-effort, social and physical activities</span></u></a>. Encourage employees to mute work notifications (email, phone calls, etc.) after hours. Discourage sending emails outside of work hours. This may require managers to balance their employees’ responsibilities so they do not <em>have to</em> work after hours.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Employees who work late shifts or unpredictable hours, including <a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article-abstract/64/5/352/1436973?redirectedFrom=fulltext" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">on-call</span></u><span style="color:#000000"> </span><u><span style="color:#467886">medical staff</span></u></a> or emergency response workers, may need special attention, support, and flexibility. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Employees may choose to work overtime or work multiple jobs in order to meet a financial need, sacrificing rest and sleep. Employee compensation should be such that they do not have to compromise their sleep and health to make ends meet.
