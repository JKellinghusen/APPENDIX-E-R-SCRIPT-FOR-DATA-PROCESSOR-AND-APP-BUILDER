	<span style="font-weight:bold; ">Make schedules as flexible and predictable as possible </span>
</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt">
	<b>Why it matters</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Unstable and unpredictable work schedules contribute to economic hardship, stress, and work-life conflicts that negatively impact employees' physical and mental well-being. Many workers, particularly those in industries such as hospitality, retail, and construction, receive their schedules with little notice, making it difficult to plan for childcare, transportation, and personal responsibilities. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	For humanitarian and development organizations, unpredictable schedules can be especially challenging for field staff and those responding to crises. While job demands may vary based on emergencies and project needs, organizations can still implement policies that provide as much stability as possible. Flexible scheduling options, such as allowing workers to set their own start and end times, use compressed workweeks, or work remotely when feasible, can improve job satisfaction and reduce burnout.

	<b>Recommendations</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Flexible schedules and employee autonomy go hand in hand (see the guidance on autonomy).
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Provide employees who have irregular schedules with advance notice when schedule changes occur to help them plan for personal responsibilities and reduce uncertainty. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Implement flexible start and end times to <a href="https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/files/2019/10/Its-About-Time-How-Work-Schedule-Instability-Matters-for-Workers-Families-and-Racial-Inequality.pdf" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">accommodate employees’ personal needs</span></u></a> while ensuring operational efficiency. <a href="https://hr.umn.edu/Employees/Current-Employees/Work-Flexibility/Best-Practices-Implementation/Best-Practices-Flexible" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">Offer remote or hybrid work options</span></u></a> for employees whose roles allow it, enabling them to better balance work and personal obligations. Ensure workers are not penalized for using flexible options by reinforcing a workplace culture that normalizes flexible scheduling rather than stigmatizing it.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Work with managers to plan projects in a way that reduces last-minute schedule changes and ensure that workers are fairly compensated when unexpected shifts arise. If schedule changes or overtime hours become a frequent occurrence, work with the employees and managers involved to come up with a more sustainable approach, which may include redistributing tasks and responsibilities.
