	<span style="font-weight:bold; ">Engage workers in workplace decisions </span>
</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:12pt">
	<b>Why it matters</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Engaging workers in decision-making fosters <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385487184_Employee_participation_in_decision-making_and_organizational_commitment_A_study_of_modern_organizations" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">a sense of ownership, improves job satisfaction, and enhances organizational effectiveness</span></u></a>. When employees have a voice in shaping workplace policies, mission statements, and operational strategies, they feel more valued and are more likely to remain committed to their work.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	For humanitarian and development organizations,<a href="https://jhumanitarianaction.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41018-024-00158-5" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">&#xa0;</span></u><u><span style="color:#467886">worker engagement is particularly important</span></u></a> given the complexity of the work and the challenges of operating in high-stress environments. Employees on the ground often have firsthand knowledge of local conditions, making their input crucial for designing effective and culturally appropriate interventions. Organizations that fail to incorporate staff perspectives risk implementing policies that are disconnected from realities in the field, ultimately affecting program outcomes. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Furthermore, inclusive decision-making leads to better leadership accountability and more equitable workplace structures. When employees have opportunities to contribute to decisions, organizations can <a href="https://peoplepossibility.com/the-importance-of-involving-employees-in-decision-making-aligning-employees-for-success/" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">improve transparency, strengthen team cohesion</span></u></a>, and <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/team-decision-making" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">drive innovation</span></u></a>.

	<b>Recommendations</b>
</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Include frontline staff in decision-making</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	<a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Localizing-Humanitarian-Action_web.pdf" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">Frontline employees have invaluable contextual knowledge</span></u></a> that is vital to <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/team-decision-making" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">tactical, operational, and strategic decision-making</span></u></a>. The definition of “frontline” depends on your organization’s structure and can include anyone from “boots on the ground” field workers to country-level leadership or even administrative workers, if the decision affects them. Make sure to include employees at all levels in these discussions and let them know that their insight is valued. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Including employees in the strategic planning process improves alignment between leadership vision and frontline realities, increasing the likelihood of employees’ commitment to the strategy and, ultimately, program success. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	For projects where quick decision-making is critical, give teams the autonomy to <a href="https://www.xref.com/blog/empowering-employee-decision-making-for-organisational-success" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">adapt strategies and programs based on real-time conditions</span></u></a>. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Ensure that leaders throughout the organization utilize participatory decision-making by including the topic in trainings and workshops, emphasizing its importance, and equipping managers with the skills to facilitate inclusive discussions. 
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Establish transparent communication channels</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Create <a href="https://www.xref.com/blog/empowering-employee-decision-making-for-organisational-success" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">clear and consistent communication channels</span></u></a> that allow employees to stay informed about major decisions and understand how their input has been incorporated, such as internal newsletters, staff briefings, or virtual team platforms. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Conversely, give employees a way to provide feedback outside of structured planning sessions. This may take the form of <a href="Giving%20Constructive%20Feedback" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">virtual suggestion boxes, focus groups, or town hall meetings</span></u></a>, and may be open-ended or dedicated to specific topics like workplace conditions, operational strategies, or organizational culture.
