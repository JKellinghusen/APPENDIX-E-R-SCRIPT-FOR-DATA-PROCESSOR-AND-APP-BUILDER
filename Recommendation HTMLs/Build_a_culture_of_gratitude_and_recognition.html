	<b>Why it matters</b>
</h3>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Workplaces that practice gratitude and recognition <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236441/employee-recognition-low-cost-high-impact.aspx" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">foster employee engagement, motivation, and retention</span></u></a>. For aid organizations, where employees often work in high-pressure environments, <a href="https://jhumanitarianaction.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41018-024-00158-5" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">recognition plays a critical role in maintaining well-being and resilience</span></u></a>. A culture of appreciation can improve team cohesion, prevent burnout, and enhance overall effectiveness.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Moreover, fostering a culture of gratitude creates a <a href="https://www.thrivesparrow.com/blog/employee-recognition-programs" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">ripple effect</span></u></a>, as employees who feel appreciated are more likely to recognize and support their peers, contributing to a positive and collaborative workplace environment.

	<b>Recommendations</b>
</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:8pt; font-size:11pt">
	<u><span style="font-weight:normal; ">Establish formal recognition programs</span></u>
</h4>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Whether it’s the tried-and-tested “Employee of the Month” or a more innovative model, structured recognition programs ensure that employees at all levels receive meaningful recognition. Follow best practices when implementing these programs, such as ensuring that recognition is <a href="https://blog.happily.ai/aligning-employee-recognition-with-company-values-a-powerful-culture-building-tool/" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">connected to your mission</span></u></a> as well as <a href="https://www.greatplacetowork.com/resources/blog/creating-a-culture-of-recognition" style="text-decoration:none"><em><u><span style="color:#467886">specific, timely,</span></u></em><u><span style="color:#467886"> and provides </span></u><em><u><span style="color:#467886">meaningful rewards</span></u></em></a><em>.</em> Rewards can be equally creative, and while cash is a popular option, alternatives include additional paid time off, branded goods, and professional development opportunities. <a href="https://www.achievers.com/blog/culture-of-recognition/" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">Creative rewards</span></u></a> tailored to employees’ interests are a great way to demonstrate appreciation.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Ensure that someone – perhaps even a whole team – is dedicated to managing staff recognition. These programs can be a big lift and if they are inconsistent, poorly executed, or lackluster, they can lose their effectiveness or even backfire – if they are perceived as placating rather than genuine.

	While <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236441/employee-recognition-low-cost-high-impact.aspx" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">recognition from leaders can be very meaningful</span></u></a>, a culture of gratitude and recognition that permeates the organization empowers employees to appreciate one another and build a more positive workplace. Leaders and managers can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2022/04/24/how-to-create-a-culture-of-gratitude-at-work/" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">foster peer-to-peer recognition</span></u></a> by celebrating employee contributions through verbal praise, written appreciation, or public acknowledgments, and motivating their staff to do the same. 
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt">
	Encourage managers to <a href="https://hr.arizona.edu/supervisors/employee-team-development/employee-recognition" style="text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:#467886">adapt their approach</span></u></a> to their team and work environment. A field office may have a physical “appreciation wall,” while a remote team can incorporate shoutouts into their standing meetings.
